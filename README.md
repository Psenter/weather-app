# Weather App

## Description:
This is going to be a application where people can put their zip code in and the page will return the weather for their area.

### Wish list:
1. Only use JS to render app
2. Get weather based on location rather than people putting in zip (give user option)
3. Store multiple locations for weather
4. Save location in local storage
5. Use more data provided by API
5. Keep track of page if user refreshes
6. Dynamically change CSS and JS based on current weather
